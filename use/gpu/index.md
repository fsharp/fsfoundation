GPU execution is a technique for high-performance financial, image processing and other 
data-parallel numerical programming.

The following options are available for executing F# on the GPU. Further options may be available in the
context of F# or .NET programming.  If you would like an option added here, please email fsharp@fsharp.org.

### Option 1 - Use Alea.cuBase, for F#-enabled CUDA programming 

* See [the Quantlea pages on Alea.cuBase](http://www.quantalea.net/products/). 
* Quantlea are also a consulting company
  providing consulting services for F# and financial GPU programming.

<br />

### Option 2 - Use StatFactory's FCore library, a GPU-enabled F# maths/stats library

* See [the StatFactory FCore page](http://www.statfactory.co.uk).


<br />

### Option 3 - Use FSGPU, an F# open source library for CUDA programming

* See [the FSGPU project](http://fsgpu.codeplex.com/)

<br />

### Option 4 - Use SharpShaders, an MIT-licensed F# tool to write GPU shader code

* See [the SharpShaders project](http://github.com/rookboom/SharpShaders/wiki/)
