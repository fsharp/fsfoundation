### Option 1: Use WebSharper

![WebSharper](/images/thumbs/WebSharper.png)&nbsp;[WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com) supports F# and can be used to make F# client-side or cross-tier HTML5 web apps. These can be used from any HTML5-enabled browser.


<br />

### Option 2: Use Fable

[Fable](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fable) is an F# to JS compiler designed to generate clean
and standard code in order to maximize interoperability in both ways. It integrates with most
of JS development pipelines like [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
or [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/). Fable allows you develop
not only web apps but also [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), desktop with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)
or mobile with [React native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

<br />

### Option 3: Use FunScript

[FunScript](http://funscript.info/) is a lightweight F# library that lets you rapidly develop single-page applications. You can connect to external data sources and call REST APIs with intellisense, produce dashboards using JavaScript visualization libraries and write asynchronous computations easily without explicit callbacks. You can use any IDE and get autocomplete while using all F# langauge features.

<br />

### Option 4: Use F# on the Server with JavaScript, CoffeeScript or TypeScript on the client

You can use F# on the server with JavaScript, CoffeeScript or TypeScript as the front end, in conjunction 
with modern JS/HTML5 web frameworks. More details at [F# Web Programming](/guides/web/).
