### Option 1: Install F# 3.0 alone

To use F# 3.0 on Mac OSX, simply:

*  [Install Mono 3.0.2 or later](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html). This includes F# 3.0.

You can now start F# Interactive using "fsharpi" and type "1+1;;".  You're 
off! The F# command line compiler is "fsharpc". The --resident flag makes the 
compiler faster on subsequent invocations.  You can use xbuild to build projects and
solutions from Visual Studio without change

<br />

### Option 2: Install F# 3.0 with Xamarin Visual Tools:

* [Install Mono 3.0.2 or later](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html). This includes F# 3.0.
* [Install Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio) or [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com). Run and check it is version 4.0.3, Build 13 or later under "About". Update using the Alpha channel of "Tools --> Addin Manager" if needed
* Go to the AddIn Manager and

  Add “Language Bindings –> F# Language Binding” 
  
  Add “Mac Development –> F# Support for MonoMac and Xamarin.Mac Development”
  
  Optionally, add “Mobile Development –> F# Support for Android Development”

  Optionally, add “Mobile Development –> F# Support for iOS Development”

You can now create new projects in Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop. Ignore any unresolved FSharp.Core.dll.

<br />

### Option 3: Make HTML5 web apps via WebSharper

* [WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com) can make F# HTML5 web apps which can be used from Mac/OSX and any HTML5-enabled browser

<br />


### Option 4: Learn F# in the Browser on the Mac

* [Learn F# online at Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org)

<br />

### Having trouble?

* Ask questions at the [F# Open Source Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/fsharp-opensource)

### What should I use to edit my code?

Some editors have specific support for F#, either builtin or through addons provided by the F# community: 
* We recommend [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio) or [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com) with the [F# AddIn for MonoDevelop](http://fsharp.github.com/fsharpbinding). 
* Emacs. There is an [F# mode for Emacs](http://fsharp.github.com/fsharpbinding/) that extends Emacs with syntax highlighting for F#, support for working with F# Interactive and also automatic indentation. 
* VIM
* SublimeText
