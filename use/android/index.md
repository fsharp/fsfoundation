### Option 1: Build Android Applications using Xamarin Studio's F# Support

1. Get the normal [Visual F# tools for Windows](/use/windows) or [F# Tools for Mac](/use/mac)
2. Get [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download)
3. Run Xamarin Studio. Check it is version 4.0.3, Build 13 or later under "About". Update using the Alpha channel of "Tools --> Addin Manager" if needed.
4. Go to Tools --> Addin Manager --> Gallery --> Language Bindings and add "F# Language Binding" (version 3.2.15 or later)
5. Go to Tools --> Addin Manager --> Gallery --> Mobile Development and add "F# Support for Xamarin.Android Development" (version 4.0 or later)

You can now create a new F# solution such as an "F# Honeycomb Application".  
Build and Debug will deploy to an emulator or device.

Report problems to the [F# Open Source Group email list](http://fsharp.github.com/fsharp) and/or Xamarin.

#### Option 2: Build HTML5 and Windows Store apps using F# WebSharper

* Use [WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com) to make HTML5 and WinJS web apps written in F#. These can 
  be deployed either as HTML5 web apps or direct to the Windows 8 app store.
