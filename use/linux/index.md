To help with Linux packages, please email the [F# Open Source Group](http://fsharp.github.com).

Once installed, see the [Linux and Cross-Platform Development Guide](/guides/mac-linux-cross-platform) to
go further.

### Option 1: Build and install the F# 3.0 runtime, compiler and tools


1. Get Mono, the runtime used by F#. Either [follow these instructions](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html) or use:

        sudo apt-get install mono-devel
   
   or build and install version 3.0 (needed for xbuild support)
   
        sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf g++ gettext make git
        git clone https://github.com/mono/mono
        cd mono
        ./autogen.sh   --prefix /usr
        make get-monolite-latest
        make
        sudo make install

   If installing to a private prefix, [follow these instructions](http://mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments) and ensure LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the "lib" directory of that prefix location {{   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/mono/lib/"  }}. 

2. Build and install the F# Compiler (open edition) from source.

        sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool pkg-config make git
        git clone https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp
        cd fsharp
        ./autogen.sh --prefix /usr
        make
        sudo make install

   If installing to a different prefix, use the same prefix as for the F# runtime above.

   Common commands are:

        fsharpi                            (starts F# interactive)
        fsharpc                            (F# compiler)
        xbuild                             (builds .fsproj projects and .sln files, authored in MonoDevelop or Visual Studio)
        mono file.exe arg1 ... argN        (runs a compiled F# program)
        mkbundle --static file.exe -o file (makes a static native image for an F# program, including the F# runtime)

### Option 2: Get the F# 3.0 Debian packages

Currently, F# is only available in Debian [unstable](http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/)
(see the [the package home page](http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/fsharp.html)).
If you're already running unstable, simply run `aptitude install fsharp fsharp-console` as root.
Otherwise, follow the following steps:

1. Add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list:

        deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free 
        deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free 

2. Add unstable to /etc/apt/preferences with a low pin-priority. For
   example, pinning unstable packages at -10 will ensure that aptitude
   will never automatically upgrade or install packages from unstable.
   The following preferences file is suitable for Debian testing:

        Package: *
        Pin: release o=Debian,a=testing
        Pin-Priority: 990

        Package: *
        Pin: release o=Debian,a=unstable
        Pin-Priority: -10

   If you want aptitude to upgrade fsharp automatically, use a pin-priority
   greater than or equal to 100. See [apt_preferences(5)](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?sektion=5&query=apt_preferences&apropos=0&manpath=sid&locale=en)
   for more details.

3. Install the fsharp packages with the following commands as root:

        aptitude update
        aptitude -t unstable install fsharp fsharp-console libfsharp-compiler4.3-cil \
            libfsharp-core4.3-cil libfsharp-compiler-interactive-settings4.3-cil \
            libfsharp-compiler-interactive-settings4.3-cil
        ln -s /usr/lib/cli/FSharp.*-4.3/*{dll,xml,sigdata,optdata} /usr/lib/mono/4.0

   If unstable has a positive pin-priority, you can replace the second
   command with `aptitude install fsharp fsharp-console`.
   The last line is needed due to packaging bugs [706683](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=706683) and [705906](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705906).

### Option 3: Get the F# 3.0 CentOS/RHEL/SciLinux packages with puppet

This option is great if you are using puppet for deployment/provisioning of servers. It will
work equally well on your local machine as it will on the server that you deploy your mono
service to.

You find the puppet module at: https://github.com/haf/puppet-mono

Usage:

        class { 'mono':
          package_source => 'https://cdn.intelliplan.eu/dev/mono-3.0.6-1.x86_64.rpm''
        }

### Option 4: Installation on Gentoo/Funtoo

There is an overlay available with current versions dotnet programs, available are F#, FAKE, nuget, etc.

1. Add the "dotnet" overlay from layman. (If you need to set it up, there is a [Manual](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml) on the Gentoo site.)

        layman -a dotnet 

2. Now you can build F#.

        emerge fsharp
        
3. (Optional) There are emacs mode and monodevelop bindings, you can chose what you want by setting use flags alike in following example:

        USE="+emacs -monodevelop" emerge fsharpbinding


### Option 5: Use a Vagrant VM on Windows

To use F# on Linux VMs on Windows, use [F# with Vagrant](http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/test-csharp-fsharp-on-mono-with-vagrant.html).


### Option 6: Make JS/HTML5 web apps and run them in your browser

See [Using F# for HTML5 Web Applications](/use/html5)
