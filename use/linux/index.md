To help with Linux packages, please email the [F# Open Source Group](http://fsharp.github.com).  You can also 
[submit an edit to this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/blob/gh-pages/use/linux/index.md).

### Option 1: Use the F# Debian packages 

F# is available as a [Debian package](http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/fsharp.html).

If you have access to _unstable_ or _trusty/universe_ packages, use:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install mono-runtime-common 
        sudo apt-get install fsharp libmono-compilerservices-symbolwriter4.0-cil

This installs `fsharpc` and `fsharpi`. If you don't have access to unstable or trusty/universe, see Option 6 below.


Once installed, see the [Linux and Cross-Platform Development Guide](/guides/mac-linux-cross-platform) to
go further.


### Option 2: Build and install the F# 3.0 runtime, compiler and tools


1. Get Mono, the runtime used by F#. Either [follow these instructions](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html) or use:

        sudo apt-get install mono-devel
   
   or build and install version 3.0 (needed for xbuild support)
   
        sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf g++ gettext make git
        git clone https://github.com/mono/mono
        cd mono
        ./autogen.sh   --prefix /usr
        make get-monolite-latest
        make
        sudo make install

   If installing to a private prefix, [follow these instructions](http://mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments) and ensure LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the "lib" directory of that prefix location {{   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/mono/lib/"  }}. 

2. Build and install the F# Compiler (open edition) from source.

        sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool pkg-config make git
        git clone https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp
        cd fsharp
        ./autogen.sh --prefix /usr
        make
        sudo make install

   If installing to a different prefix, use the same prefix as for the F# runtime above.

Once installed, see the [Linux and Cross-Platform Development Guide](/guides/mac-linux-cross-platform) to
go further.


### Option 3: Get the F# 3.0 CentOS/RHEL/SciLinux packages with puppet

Compiling the RPMs is easy with
[FPM-recipes](https://github.com/haf/fpm-recipes). This will give you a *mono*
RPM and a *fsharp* RPM. Either you install these directly on your target system,
or you set up a [yum repository](https://github.com/haf/puppet-yum) to host
them.

When you have RPMs, the rest is really easy with
[puppet-mono](https://github.com/haf/puppet-mono) and
[puppet-fsharp](https://github.com/haf/puppet-fsharp) which take care of pulling
in the packages for you. The mono module also updates the CA-authority list from
Mozilla so that you don't get problems with HTTPS requests.

        include mono
        include fsharp

Or alternatively from the command line:

        sudo yum install -y mono fsharp

You can now do:

        fsharpi

Once installed, see the [Linux and Cross-Platform Development Guide](/guides/mac-linux-cross-platform) to
go further.


### Option 4: Get the F# 3.1 on Gentoo ( Sabayon / Funtoo / Calculate )

From portage tree:

        emerge fsharp

Alternatively there is an overlay available with current versions dotnet programs, available are F#, FAKE, nuget, etc.

1. Add the "dotnet" overlay from layman. (If you need to set it up, there is a [Manual](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml) on the Gentoo site.)

        layman -a dotnet 

2. Now you can build F#.

        emerge fsharp
        
3. (Optional) There are emacs mode and monodevelop bindings, you can chose what you want by setting use flags alike in following example:

        USE="+emacs -monodevelop" emerge fsharpbinding

Once installed, see the [Linux and Cross-Platform Development Guide](/guides/mac-linux-cross-platform) to
go further.


### Option 5: Use a Vagrant VM on Windows

To use F# on Linux VMs on Windows, use [F# with Vagrant](http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/test-csharp-fsharp-on-mono-with-vagrant.html).


### Option 6: Get acces to the Debian packages

If you are using Debian packages and don't have access to unstable or trusty/universe packages, then 
follow the following steps:

1. Add the following using `sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list`:

        deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free 
        deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free 

2. Add the following using `sudo vi /etc/apt/preferences`:

        Package: *
        Pin: release o=Debian,a=testing
        Pin-Priority: 990

        Package: *
        Pin: release o=Debian,a=unstable
        Pin-Priority: 100

   If you don't want aptitude to upgrade fsharp automatically, use a pin-priority below 100. 

3. Install the fsharp packages with the following commands as root:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install mono-runtime-common 
        sudo apt-get install fsharp libmono-compilerservices-symbolwriter4.0-cil
