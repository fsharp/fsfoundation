F# has a wide range of useful data import and access techniques available. Many F# books
and introductions cover some of these. 

The Type Provider feature of 
F# 3.0 brings simplicity to accessing both regular and irregular data, including traditional databases,
web-scale data and standard structured text formats like JSON, and XML.

[Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org/learn) has specific tutorials related to data access. 

If the data access libraries you need are not listed here, you can search for them on [NuGET](http://nuget.org). 

### SQL Data Access

A wide range of high-quality libraries exist for SQL data access from F#. Many can be found on [NuGET](http://nuget.org).
Some resources are listed below:

 * [The SqlDataConnection Type Provider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361033.aspx) - For accessing SQL using F# 3.0 LINQ queries
 * [The SqlEntityConnection Type Provider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361035.aspx) - For accessing SQL using F# 3.0 LINQ queries and Entity Framework
 * [ADO.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa286484.aspx) - A set of classes that expose data access services to the .NET programmer

### CSV, XML and JSON data

Many [NuGET](http://nuget.org) packages exist for document access. Some specific frameworks dedicated to simplifying document data  access are:

 * Direct access to CSV and other log file formats is simple. For example, see [Log File Analysis with F#](http://jyliao.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/log-analysis-with-f.html)

 * [FSharp.Data](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Data/) - The F# Data library (FSharp.Data.dll) implements functionality to access data in your F# applications and scripts. 

   It implements F# type providers for working with structured file formats (CSV, JSON and XML) and for accessing the WorldBank and Freebase data. It also includes helpers for parsing JSON files and for sending HTTP requests.

 * [Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/) - "Serialize All Things"

### Data Stores

The F# Type Provider machanism allows for the direct integration of scalable data stores into F# programming. Some specific examples are:

 * [Freebase](http://freeebase.com) - A type provider for Freebase is available in the [FSharp.Data](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library
 * [World Bank](http://worldbank.org) - A type provider for the World bank data sets is available in the [FSharp.Data](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library
