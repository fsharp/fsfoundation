Many of us have been lucky to have mentors in our careers who have helped us become better programmers (and people).

We think that mentorship is a powerful way to help you learn and be inspired, especially in a new paradigm such as functional programming.
So we here at the F# Software Foundation (FSSF)  would like to help make to mentorship possible for those in the F# community who would benefit from it.

Read more about the program [here](about.html).

### Who is it for? How does it work? How much does it cost?

This program will be useful for developers at all levels, with or without F# experience.

The program is free-of-charge (the mentors are volunteering their time to benefit the F# community), but
you must be a member of the FSSF to participate in the program. Membership is free. Learn more about membership [here](http://foundation.fsharp.org/membership). If you're ready to [join](http://foundation.fsharp.org/join), you can do that [here](http://foundation.fsharp.org/join).

More details [here](about.html).
