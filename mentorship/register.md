## Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer (for prospective mentors)

You can be a mentor! You really can!

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need more experience, more F# in production, more blog posts before you can mentor someone else.

Your F# experience is valuable, and can help those just learning F#. It's okay if you don't know everything about the language or the core libraries, or all of the details of popularly used frameworks. Nobody does. The F# community and the FSSF are here to help you! You can do it!

Thank you for considering being a mentor!
