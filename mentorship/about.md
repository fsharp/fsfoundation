headline: About the F# Mentorship program
---

Many of us have been lucky to have mentors in our careers who have helped us become better programmers (and people).

We think that mentorship is a powerful way to help you learn and be inspired, especially in a new paradigm such as functional programming. So we here at the F# Software Foundation (FSSF)  would like to help make to mentorship possible for those in the F# community who would benefit from it.

And so, we have created a FSSF Mentorship program! 

We are going to keep the program small for now. The first mentorship batch will be just a handful of mentors and learners providing one-to-one mentorship for about 8 weeks.  After this initial batch, we'll gather feedback and see what changes the program needs before starting the next batch.

This program is offered free of charge, as mentors are volunteering their time. The FSSF is sponsoring this program and providing the coordination between mentors and learners. 

### Who is it for?

The F# mentorship program connects you to a experienced F# developer who can help you improve your F# programming skills, and best practices for developing in F#.

This program will be useful for developers at all levels, Even if you have F# experience, you may want a deep dive into some particular topic such as web development, distributed programming, machine learning, data science and so on. 

You must be a member of the FSSF to participate in the program. Membership is free - see http://foundation.fsharp.org/membership

### How does it work?

You get a certain amount of minutes a week (30 by default) with a mentor for certain amount of weeks (8 by default) working on some particular area.

### How much does it cost?

The program is free-of-charge. The mentors are volunteering their time to benefit the F# community. However, in return we ask that “pay it forward” later on, by mentoring someone else or contributing to the F# community in other ways (such as helping with F# open source projects). 

### What do I need to do next?

Unfortunately, you need to wait until the beginning of August, then further information will be available [here](register.html). Any updates will be on twitter [@fsharporg](https://twitter.com/fsharporg) too.

### Questions or comments?

If you have any questions or comments, please get in touch via email (education(at)fsharp.org) or twitter [@fsharporg](https://twitter.com/fsharporg).
