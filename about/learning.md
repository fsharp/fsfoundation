This comprehensive introduction to the principles of functional programming using F# 
shows how to apply basic theoretical concepts to produce succinct and elegant programs. 
It demonstrates the role of functional programming in a wide spectrum of applications 
including databases and systems. Coverage also includes advanced features in the .NET 
library, the imperative features of F# and topics such as text processing, sequences, 
computation expressions and asynchronous computation. With a broad spectrum of examples 
and exercises, the book is perfect for courses in functional programming and for self-study. 
Enhancing its use as a text is an accompanying website with downloadable programs, lecture 
slides, a mini-projects and links to further F# sources.
