Versions of the logo have also been made specifically to be used for derivations and combining
within other project logos.  These are monochromatic, semi-opaque versions which should be used 
on a solid background, in order to make a composite logo image with another project.

Variants using a "lighter" color scheme are preferred,and intended for usage on a dark or fully
saturated background.  The "darker" scheme is intended for compositing with lighter backgrounds, 
or scenarios when the lighter variant does not blend well. Note that the lighter variant will
not be visible when viewed directly in a browser, as it's comprised of white color on a transparent
background.
