Projects and companies that are using F# are welcome and encouraged to incorporate the F#
logo on their website, brochures, and other media.  The logo can be used anywhere suitable
to indicate a project is intended for use with F# or was implemented in F#.

## Guidelines for Use

![F# Logo](/img/logo.png)

The F# logo is a trademark of the F# Software Foundation, which is responsible for defending 
against any damaging or confusing uses of the trademark.

Usage of the logo is allowed, provided that the logo remains uchanged.  Do not alter the
color, proportions, or the image in any way.

The logo is available in the following variants:

 * [PNG, 128x128, Transparent Background](/img/logo/fsharp128.png)
 * [PNG, 256x256, Transparent Background](/img/logo/fsharp256.png)
 * [PNG, 512x512, Transparent Background](/img/logo/fsharp512.png)
 * [PNG, 2048x2048, Transparent Background](/img/logo/fsharp2048.png)

Versions of the logo have also been made specifically to be used for derivations and combining
within other project logos.  These are monochromatic, semi-opaque versions which should be used 
on a solid background, in order to make a composite logo image with another project.

Variants using a "lighter" color scheme are preferred,and intended for usage on a dark or fully
saturated background.  The "darker" scheme is intended for compositing with lighter backgrounds, 
or scenarios when the lighter variant does not blend well. Note that the lighter variant will
not be visible when viewed directly in a browser, as it's comprised of white color on a transparent
background.

 * [PNG, Darker variant, 100x100, Transparent Background](/img/logo/fsharp100mcdark.png)

These versions can be used to create logos for projects, companies, or solutions which either
use F# in their implementation or are specifically intended for use from F#.

The preferred font for use with the logo is [Rajdhani](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rajdhani), 
an open source typeface.

Usage of the logo for any other purpose is not allowed without prior approval and permission from 
the F# Software Foundation.  For more information or to get permission for other scenarios, please 
contact the F# Software Foundation at [fsharp@fsharp.org](mailto:fsharp@fsharp.org).
