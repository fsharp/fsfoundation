headline: Machine Learning with F#
---

F# is ideally suited to machine learning because of its efficient execution, succinct style,
data access capabilities and scalability. F# has been successfully used by some of the most advanced machine learning teams in the world,
including the Microsoft Research Machine Learning and Applied Games groups at Microsoft Research, Cambridge.

[Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org/learn) has some introductory machine learning algorithms.
Further resources related to different aspects of machine learning are below. 

See also the [Math and Statistics](/math) and [Data Science](/data-science) sections for related material.

### Machine Learning Packages 

Several F#/.NET Machine Learning packages are available be [searching on nuget.org](http://nuget.org/packages?q=machine+learning), for example:

 * [Accord.MachineLearning](http://nuget.org/packages/Accord.MachineLearning/) - Contains Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayesian models, K-means, Gaussian Mixture models and general algorithms such as Ransac, Cross-validation and Grid-Search for machine-learning applications. This package is part of the Accord.NET Framework.
 * [Encog Machine Learning Framework](http://nuget.org/packages/encog-dotnet-core/) - An advanced neural network and machine learning framework. Encog 
   contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using multithreaded resilient propagation. Encog can also make use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based workbench is also provided to help model and train neural networks. 
 * [Numl](http://nuget.org/packages/numl/) - A machine learning library intended to ease the use of using standard modeling techniques for both prediction and clustering
