I have written an application to balance the national power generation schedule for a portfolio 
of power stations to a trading position for an energy company. The client and server components 
were in C# but the calculation engine was written in F#. 

The use of F# to address the complexity at the heart of this application clearly demonstrates 
a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software, namely algorithmically complex 
analysis of large data sets. My experience has been a very positive one.

Building valuation models for derivative trades requires rapid development of mathematical models, made possible by 
composition of lower-level model components. We have found that F#, with the associated toolset, provides a 
unique combination of features that make it very well suited to this kind of development. In this talk, I will explain how we 
are using F# and show why it is a good match. I will also talk about the problems we have had, 
and outline future enhancements that would benefit this kind of work.

Around 95% of the code in these projects has been developed in F#. F# allowed for rapid development 
of prototypes, and thus also rapid verification or falsification of the underlying mathematical models.
Complex algorithms, for example to compute Nash equilibria in game theory, can be expressed 
succinctly.  Units of measure reduced the chance of errors dramatically: 
Prices, probabilities, derivatives, etc. can already be kept apart at compile time.

> The performance is phenomenal.  We can now re-calculate the entire bank portfolio from scratch in

1. Jan Erik Ekelof, M.Sc.

3. Handelsbanken 
4. [permalink](#handelsbanken-1)
 
 I first evaluated F# back in 2006 - 2007 for the purpose of math oriented high performance applications within 
 Financial Risk. I got in spring 2009 a mission to implement a new Real-time Counter-party Risk system covering 
 all possible present and future deal types within the entire bank. The effort was started with only three 
 resources, me as architect and lead developer and two colleagues – one risk expert and one high performing 
 developer. Our first intention was to use C#, but I did a quick proof-of-concept with F# implementing a low 
 level TCP/IP-communication to an existing risk-system. This showed us and our  management that F# could give 
 us a real productivity boost due to its support for multiple paradigms and functional concepts together with 
 an impressive support for multi-threading. 
 
 Our first delivery is approaching rapidly and F# has proved itself as a real life-saver. We started off using 
 C# in many places but have since then moved almost entirely into F# due to its ability to reduce the amount of 
 code required and its simplicity when developing massive parallel computations. The performance is phenomenal. 
 We can now re-calculate the entire bank portfolio from scratch in less than a second and the response-time for 
 single deal verification calculation is far below 100 milliseconds(the original demand was 200 milliseconds to 
 make the application usable for electronic markets). Although some gains are to be attributed to how we have built 
 our calculation models, F# made it possible for us to implement our algorithms and techniques with very little code 
 and with a huge similarity to the original mathematical models and regulations (which is important for verification 
 of correctness). We have also been able to use the support for Async-workflows producing code that is simple and 
 clear and easy to understand but still runs in parallel when required. 
 
 The present application contains 35 to 40.000 lines of F#-code and an equal amount of C#-code. However, our 
 estimate is that the F# code contains at least 80% of the functionality (which is pretty amazing!). Our experience 
 shows us that the number of code lines shrinks with a ratio of 1/2 to 1/4 by just porting functionality from 
 C# to F# (not counting single character or empty lines in the C#-code). We have by remodeling increased the 
 ratio to the area of 1/5 to 1/8, where the remodeling involves replacing object oriented constructs with 
 functional ones (and actually removing mutable states). One example from last week was a limit-utilization 
 module written in F# but using an object-oriented approach containing +300 lines of code. I rewrote it to 
 below 70 lines of code just by shifting paradigm (and the rewrite made it much easier to understand and verify)!

For nearly 75 years, Grange Insurance has offered competitive products and services to policyholders 
in more than a dozen U.S. states. To maintain its well-earned reputation and standing, the company decided to 
enhance its rating engine—a software tool for rating policies and performing what-if modeling, impact analyses, 
and other vital activities. Working with the Sophic Group and using the Microsoft Visual Studio Team System development 
environment and F# programming language, Grange Insurance parallelized its rating engine to take
better advantage of multicore server hardware, and in so doing garnered significant performance benefits. 
Processes that used to require hours now take just minutes, enabling the company to trim time-to-market 
by weeks and making it far easier for independent agents to sell and service Grange products.

> Aviva developed an entire pension quote calculator entirely in F# in under 100 days with no prior F# experience at all...

1. **Aviva**, via [Flying Frog Consultancy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/952318/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-c-sharp-vs-f-or-f-vs-c), [source 2](http://www.quora.com/Which-organizations-use-the-F-programming-language-in-a-non-trivial-fashion/answer/Jon-Harrop-1), [source 3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179332/anyone-actually-using-f-in-production)
2. [permalink](#aviva-flying-frog-1)

Aviva (one of the world's largest insurance companies) have F# code in production, are starting several 
more projects in F#. We are currently consulting for Aviva (£2.5bn profit) who have migrated 
some of their number crunching and business logic to F# and are so happy with the results 
(10x faster and 10x less code vs their Visual C++ 6) that they are proposing to migrate 1,600,000 lines of code to 
F#. In particular, their developers found F# easy to learn and use.

... my predecessor developed an entire pension quote calculator (typically scheduled to take 300-400 man days) 
entirely in F# in under 100 days with no prior F# experience at all. Performance is 10× 
better than the C++ that it replaces because the new code avoids unnecessary copying and exploits multicore 
parallelism. Part of my job here will be to give basic F# training to around 20 people and bring a few people up to expert level.

In answer to "Can you give any evidence for 10x performance gain over C++?". Aviva's C++ 
code is a simple manual translation from very inefficient Mathematica code that suffers from several pathological 
performance problems mainly centered around excessive copying. The F# rewrite does not have these problem. 
The 10x performance gain was verified by the client.

We have set up a complete risk management system that combines several data sources, presents them in a ... 
WPF user interface, and does a LOT of calculation behind the scenes. When the calculation 
requires a proper algorithm (i.e. anything that is more complex than a simple for loop), 
our choice has been F#. I have to say I keep being surprised by how compact it is and, nonetheless, 
how readable it is even when I'm reading code that I hadn't looked at or thought about for six months.

I am both a C# dev and an F# dev. I can only offer subjective anecdotal evidence based 
on my experience of delivering projects in both languages (I am too busy delivering 
software to do anything else). 
 
 That said, the one stat in the summary that I find most compelling is the defect rate. 
 I have now delivered three business critical projects written in F#. I am still waiting 
 for the first bug to come in. This is not the case with the C# projects I have delivered. 
 I will continue to monitor and report on this. It might be that I am just on a lucky streak, 
 but I suspect that the clarity and concision of F# code contributes greatly to its correctness.

With F#... we have written a complete genome re-sequencing pipeline with interface, algorithms, 
reporting in ~5K lines and it has been incredibly reliable, fast  and easy to maintain.

F# rocks - we're building out various algorithms for DNA processing here and it's like a drug.  Just 
implemented a suffix tree in 150 lines that can index 200,000 bases a second ;)    We have probably 
10-20K lines of code for many scientific applications ranging from a full genome sequencing 
pipeline that reconstructs and annotated yeast strains, to simulators for various processes 
and design tools for building DNA sequences/constructs.  There are lab located apps that 
grab robot log files and move them to databases and a tool for viewing a huge collection of DNA sequencing data.

F# has been phenomenally useful.  I would be writing a lot of this in Python otherwise and F# is more 
robust, 20x 1. 100x faster to run and for anything but the most trivial programs, faster to develop.  
The UI work is especially gratifying, because state of the art for a lot of genomic data display 
is still PNG images embedded in JavaScript and with F# I can render half a million data points on 
a web page without jumping through hoops.

With Units of Measure I started labelling the coordinates as one or zero based and immediately found a bug where I'd casually mixed the two systems. Yay F#!

I evaluated F# and it and found that for certain tasks it was better than C# in terms of performance 
while maintaining suitable readability and for certain tasks, it leant itself better to certain 
algorithms (OctTree based color quantization stands out). ...we were able to heavily leverage inline functions in F#......Since each of 
these are inlines, the F# optimizer can actually do something useful with the code. By using F#, we were able to address this cost by using 
inlining, code profiling, scanline caching, memoization and other techniques. In many cases we ended up with 
code that ran in equivalent time to C++ code or in some cases faster.

F# is central to Microsoft’s quantum algorithm research. The LIQUi|⟩ simulator (Language 
Integrated Quantum Operations) presents an extension of F# that presents a 
seamless integration of classical and quantum operations. The scale and efficiency 
of the simulator allows it to handle among the largest entangled 
systems of qubits (quantum bits) ever modeled utilizing a targeted linear algebra package 
written entirely in F#. In addition, the modular architecture allows users to 
easily extend the system in any desired research direction. The base library is 
well over 20,000 lines of code and implements a wide range of modules including 
circuits, molecular modeling, spin-glass systems, quantum error correction, machine 
learning, factoring and many others. The system runs in client, server and cloud 
environments. It is also designed to be used as an educational tool and we have 
found that bringing new users up to speed is a quick and painless process.

still finish my project with realistic code. You're never disappointed in any phase of the project!

You can formulate many problems much easier, closer to their definition and more concise in a 
functional programming language like F# and your code is less error-prone (immutability, more powerful type system, intuitive recurive algorithms). 
You can code what you mean instead of what the computer wants you to say ;-)  Furthermore you 
can have F# and C# together in one solution, so you can combine the benefits of both 
languages and use them where they're needed.

I'd recommend F# to a die hard C# developer just because learning another language 
is one way a programmer can get out of a local maxima and 
become a better programmer. And F# isn't just a different set of semantics on top of 
the same syntax as most imperative languages are, 
it's a totally different programming style. All the more to expand the capabilities 
and understanding of a programmer.

Over the last 6 or so months, I've been working on a Vim emulation layer. This is the first major project I've ever done with F# 
and I have to say I love the language. In many ways I used this project as a method of learning 
F# (and this learning curve is very much evident if you look through the history of the project). 
What I find the most amazing about F# is just how concise of a language it is. The Vim engine comprises 
the bulk of the logic yet it only comprises 30% of the overall code base.

Path of Go is powered by three technologies...: an AI capable of playing Go, the F# language, 
and TrueSkill to match online players. The AI is implemented in F# and meets the challenge of 
running efficiently in the .net compact framework on Xbox 360. This game places you in a number of 
visually stunning 3D scenes. It was fully developed in managed code using the XNA environment.

I do some samples in F# for the lectures and the book, but all that is within a single-user 
VS 2010 Pro installation. Right now we have a set of slides on functional programming with 
F# in Russian in the curriculum repository, and the video-course of functional programming 
using F# available in the largest Russian Internet-University (intuit.ru). The course 
is being taught in 2 universities. There is a noticeable interest in the developer community in 
Russia towards F#.

We are using F# because it considerably increases speed of software development which is crucial 
for a small company with limited development resources.  The most enjoyable feature of this language 
is that the developer can reason about the code instead of relying only on unit tests. 
I would say the language encourages Reason Driven Development methodology which leads to 
virtually bug-free code.  F# as strongly typed functional language ideally fits for tasks our 
software solves – Fixed Income securities trading optimization. It is also very important that 
F# computation engine could be seamlessly integrated with other parts of .NET-based software product.

I am involved in bioinformatics and computational genomics as a faculty member at the 
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).  In an academic medical center like UNMC there 
are heavy demands on my time and a wide range of different types of research projects that 
I can end up working on.  I have used the F# programming language on both the .NET and Mono 
frameworks for several of these projects, including one that involved a very productive 
collaboration with IntelliFactory and the use of WebSharper (http://www.websharper.com/home).  
You can visit the resulting [web site](http://app1/unmc.edu/fgx) and read the freely 
available peer-reviewed scientific publication that describes the important 
[infectious disease research](http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/1/e00537-12.long) 
that this F# software development project facilitates.  I am always interested in 
opportunities to work with professional software development enterprises whose teams include 
developers with F# expertise, because I believe that many attributes of the F# programming 
language make it an ideal choice for the development of software solutions that integrate 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and the exponentially growing volumes of molecular analysis 
data that can now be obtained from individual patients (e.g., personal genome DNA sequencing data).  
There's an exciting future for F# in this huge, emerging, data-rich health care market.
