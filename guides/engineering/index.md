F# is developed as a collaboration between:

* [The F# Open Engineering Group](http://fsharp.github.io/), who
  manage the cross-platform and open-source [F# Compiler and Components repositories](http://github.com/fsharp] and 
  the [F# Community Project Incubation Space](http://github.com/fsprojects).

* [The Visual F# Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/) from Microsoft, who are highly 
  active in the F# community and accept community contributions to the language, compiler and Visual F# Tools. 

* [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com), who contribute the [Xamarin F# Tools](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview/) .

* Many other companies and individuals, through both [open source projects](http://fsharp.org/community/projects/) 
  and many other components and tools.
