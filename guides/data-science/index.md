Data science is the application of statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization and programming to 
real-world data sources to bring understanding and insight to data-oriented problem domains.
F# is an excellent solution for programmatic data science as it combines efficient execution,
REPL-scripting, powerful libraries and scalable data integration.

## Interoperability

### F# and Excel 
{: #excel-interop .anchor }

[Excel-DNA](http://excel-dna.net/) is an independent project to integrate .NET into Excel. With Excel-DNA you can make native (.xll) add-ins for Excel using C#, Visual Basic.NET or F#, providing high-performance user-defined functions (UDFs), custom ribbon interfaces 
and more. Your entire add-in can be packed into a single .xll file requiring no installation or registration:

Both NPOI and EPPLus manipulate the Open Office XML format directly so they do not require having Excel installed and do not use Interop. You can read, create, and edit Excel documents using this approach.

The [F# Excel Type Provider](http://fsprojects.github.io/ExcelProvider/) is a prototypical F# type providerfor Excel that allows you  to read Excel files using typed data provided by the type provider.
