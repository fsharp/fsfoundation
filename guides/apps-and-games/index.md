### Platforms

F# executes on a broad range of app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[F# on Mac](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/HTML5](/webstacks) and [Windows](/use/windows/). See those 
sections for details about getting started with F# on those platforms.

### Mobile App Development 

These higher-level app development stacks are support F#:

* ![XamarinStudio](/images/thumbs/xamarin-studio.png)&nbsp;[Xamarin Mobile](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/introduction_to_mobile_development) - Use F# to develop for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows development

* ![WebSharper](/images/thumbs/WebSharper.png)&nbsp;[WebSharper](http://websharper.com) - Can be used for cross-tier client/server HTML5 development and more

* [Windows Store](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh913781.aspx) - You can use F# Portable libraries as components in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone applications

### MonoGame - Write Once, Play Everywhere

[MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is an open implementation of a cross-platform gaming framework originally
based on the XNA 4 framework design. The goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.

### Xamarin Game Development 

Xamarin provide game and app development tools for Android, iOS and other platforms. They [support F#](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview)
as part of their stack. 

Some resources for game development with F# and Xamarin tools:

* [F# and Monogame Part 2 – Android](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-2-android/)

* [F# and Monogame Part 3 – iOS](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-3-ios/)

Resources specific to iOS:

* Watch a wonderful video by [Rachel Reese](https://twitter.com/rachelreese) on creating a minesweeper game for iOS using F# and Xamarin:

</div>


* Watch [an introduction to iOS app development](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/f-on-ipad-and-iphone-with-xamarin-studio/mh-7404).

* You will need to familiarize yourself with Xamarin C# iOS programming and will likely need some knowledge of 
Objective-C as well.  The [Xamarin Developer Center](http://docs.xamarin.com/) contains the primary documentation. 

* Sample iOS games and apps are available from [Neil Danson's repository](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/):
 
  * [IMBD](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/imdb) -  A micro iOS app for movie database search

  * [Pacman](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/pacman) -  An iOS version of the classic game 

  * [Raytracer](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/raytracer) - An iOS version of F# image generation code

  * [Pissed Off Owls](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/pissed-off-owls) - An iOS micro game using MonoGame and the
    Farseer game engine

### Duality 
Duality is a plugin based 2D game development framework based on C# and OpenTK. To get a quick overview, please visit the [project page](http://duality.fetzenet.de). Duality's main strengh is a fully featured extensible editor. Make sure to check it out. (OSS and MIT Licensed)

F# Scripting plugin. [How to use](http://www.roundcrisis.com/2014/04/21/Fsharp-scripting-for-the-game-engine/) | [Code](https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/DualityScripting)

### Server-side of Games

F# is ideal for the sever-side of game and app development. For example, F# is used on the server-side of one of 
the largest Facebook social games, as described in [this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).

See the [Web Programming](/webstacks) and [Cloud](/cloud) section for details of using F# with server-side technologies. 


### Microsoft XNA

[Microsoft XNA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa937791.aspx) is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment that 
facilitates video game development and management.
Although it is no longer developed by Microsoft, it is still popular amond developers and an update is available to
support recent versions of Visual Studio.

### Unity3D

[Visual Studio 2013 Tools for Unity](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/20b80b8c-659b-45ef-96c1-437828fe7cf2) allows you to write and debug your Unity 3D games inside Microsoft Visual Studio.
With this plugin you can debug DLLs built with F# in Visual Studio while running them from Unity3D, however currently it does not support creating F# scripts directly inside of the Unity3D editor.
