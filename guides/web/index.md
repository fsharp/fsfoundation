F# excels at building efficient, scalable and robust web solutions. Web programming is 
based around receiving a single HTTP request and replying with a result, which maps very
well to a stateless, functional approach. Advantages to using F# for web programming include:

* *Fast* - F# code execution is fast, using native code generation from scripted or project code 
* *Succinct* - F# is concise, readable and type-safe, for fast development of robust web solutions
* *Reactive and Scalable* - F# asynchronous programming simplifies scalable, reactive web programming
* *Interoperable* - F# interoperates seamlessly with languages such as C#, JavaScript and TypeScript
* *JavaScript-ready* - F# is JavaScript-ready through [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) and [Fable](http://fable.io/)
* *Open-source* and *cross-platform*

The [Cloud Programming](/guides/cloud/) guide contains more details on scalable cloud-hosted web programming with F#.

## Web Frameworks 

<br />

#### Suave
{: #suave    .anchor }

[Suave](http://suave.io/) is a simple web development F# library providing a lightweight web server and a set of combinators to manipulate route flow and task composition.

or [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/). Fable allows you to develop
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) services, desktop apps with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)
and mobile apps with [React native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
