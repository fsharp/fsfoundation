This is an overview of the packages and tools for scalable data processing with F#,
particularly for taking advantage of scalable cloud-computing resources.

## Cloud Programming

### Amazon Web Services

[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) provide a large array of on-demand and managed computing and 
hosting services. AWS include on-demand and reserved virtual machine instances, 
a variety of storage options, a content delivery network (CDN), DNS capabilities, and many others. 
Amazon offers services from multiple data centers around the world.

Amazon offers a .NET SDK for managing the AWS services, 
[described here](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/). This SDK provides facilities for managing 
storage, compute instances, and other Amazon services.

Some additional resources for using F# and .NET on Amazon's AWS service:

### Windows Azure

[Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/overview/) provides access to  Microsoft's worldwide datacenters through services including 
virtual machines, geo-redundant storage, database clusters and website deployment.  [This page](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/fundamentals/compute/) provides 
detail on the structure of Azure applications.

## Big Data Programming and NoSQL Databases

F# can be used with many scalable data-storage systems. Some are accessible via the Cloud SDKs outlined above.
Some further resources for specific systems are:

#### Hadoop

[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) supports data-intensive distributed applications running on large 
clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop derives from Google's MapReduce and Google File System papers.

communications. This section lists a wide range of communication libraries available to F#.
