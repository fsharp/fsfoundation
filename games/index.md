##Options for Game Programming in F#

F# executes on gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[F# on Mac](/use/mac/), XBox 360, JavaScript/HTML5 and [F# on Windows](/use/windows/).

There are two main higher-level game stack that are currently of 
interest to F# users: [MonoGame][1] and 
[Microsoft XNA Game Studio][2].  Both can be used for either full blown games or 3D 
data visualisations.  An HTML5 framework such as [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) can also
be used for browser-based game development.

F# is often ideal for the sever-side of game development. For example, F# is used on the server-side
of onoe of the largest Facebook social games, as described in 
[this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).


* [MonoGame][1] is an Open Source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework. The 
  goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
  their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
  Mobile.  

  There is a [MonoDevelop][7] Mac template by Dave Thomas *(@7sharp9)*.  You can find the details of this in the following blog 
  post: [Running MonoGame with F# on the Mac][3]

* [Microsoft XNA][2] is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment provided by Microsoft that 
  facilitates video game development and management. XNA attempts to free game developers from writing 
  *repetitive boilerplate code* and to bring different aspects of game production into a single system.
