headline: Game and App Programming with F#
---

### Platforms

F# executes on app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[F# on Mac](/use/mac/), XBox 360, [JavaScript/HTML5](/webstacks) and [F# on Windows](/use/windows/). See those 
sections for details about getting started with game and app programming with F# on those platforms.

F# is often ideal for the sever-side of game and app development. See the [Web Programming](/webstacks) section for 
details of some server-side technologies. For example, F# is used on the server-sid of one of 
the largest Facebook social games, as described in [this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).
  
### App Development Stacks

There are some higher-level app development stacks of particular interest to F# users:

* [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) - Can be used for cross-tier client/server HTML5 development and more
* [Xamarin Mobile](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/introduction_to_mobile_development) - Use F# to develop for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows 8 development
* [Xamarin Mac](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/mac/getting_started/hello,_mac) - Use F# to develop applications for Mac OSX 
* [Windows Store](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh913781.aspx) - You can use F# Portable libraries as components in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone applications

### 3D Game/Visualization Stacks 

There are some higher-level advanced game/visualization stacks that are of 
particular interest to F# users: [MonoGame][1] and 
[Microsoft XNA Game Studio][2]. 

* [MonoGame][1] is an Open Source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework. The 
  goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
  their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
  Mobile.  

  There is a [MonoDevelop][7] Mac template by Dave Thomas *(@7sharp9)*.  You can find the details of this in the following blog 
  post: [Running MonoGame with F# on the Mac][3]

* [Microsoft XNA][2] is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment provided by Microsoft that 
  facilitates video game development and management. XNA attempts to free game developers from writing 
  *repetitive boilerplate code* and to bring different aspects of game production into a single system.
