Do you want to contribute to F# commmunity projects?  We encourage
all efforts which support our [mission](/foundation.html). Some of the open community projects 
you can contribute to are below. 

These projects may be at an early stage, and are not necessarily appropriate for production 
use. Out of small beginnings, great things come! 

To add a project to this list, log on to GitHub, [edit this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/edit/gh-pages/use/osprojects/index.md) and submit a pull request.
