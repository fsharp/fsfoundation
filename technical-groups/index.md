The F# Software Foundation members actively seek to encourage and facilitate F#-related meetups,
discussion groups and working groups affiliated with the foundation. 

Any F#-related group can be affiliated with the FSF, including both professional and open-source groups,
and those associated with 3rd-party commercial technologies.

The current affiliated technical groups are:

 * [**F# Web Programming Group**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/web-stack-fs) (contact Ryan Riley and Adam Granicz)
 * **F# in Finance** (contact Natallie Baikevich)
 * **F# for Data and Machine Learning** (contact Mathias Brandewinder)
 * **F# in Academia** (contact Antonio Cisternino)
 * **F# for Games and Apps** (contact Phil Trelford and Adam Granicz)

Two technical groups are closely associated with the F# Software Foundation's mission:

 * [**F# Open Engineering**](http://fsharp.github.io) (contact Michael Newton or Dave Thomas)  
 * **F# Software Foundation Communications Group** (contact [fsharp@fsharp.org](mailto:fsharp@fsharp.org))

More details of the working groups can be found by contacting the people above or 
emailing [fsharp@fsharp.org](mailto:fsharp@fsharp.org). 

We encourage groups to adopt a public presence and [submit an edit to this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/edit/gh-pages/technical-groups/index.md) with details (GitHub login required).
