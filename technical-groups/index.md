The F# Software Foundation members actively seek to encourage and facilitate community operated F# related meetups,
discussion groups, as well as working groups directly affiliated with the foundation. 

[Working Groups](https://foundation.fsharp.org/working_groups) are the official mechanism whereby the F# Software Foundation coordinates volunteer resources and engages directly with the F# community to fulfill the [Mission of the F# Software Foundation](https://foundation.fsharp.org). The following Working Groups are currently active and open to accepting new volunteers:

 * [**Training and Education Working Group**](https://foundation.fsharp.org/training_and_education_wg)
 * [**Communications Working Group**](https://foundation.fsharp.org/communications_wg)
 
More details of the working groups can be found in the [Working Groups](https://foundation.fsharp.org/working_groups) page.

Current communitiy operated technical groups which fit with [the mission](https://foundation.fsharp.org) include:

 * [**Community for F#**](http://c4fsharp.net) (contact Mathias Brandewinder and Ryan Riley)

We encourage community operated groups to adopt a public presence and [submit an edit to this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/edit/gh-pages/technical-groups/index.md) with details (GitHub login required).
